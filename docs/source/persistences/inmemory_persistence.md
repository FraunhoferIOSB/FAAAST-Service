### In Memory Persistence
The In Memory Persistence implementation keeps the AAS environment model parsed at startup in the local memory. Any change request, such as changing the value of a property, results in a change to the AAS environment model in the local memory. When the FAÂ³ST Service is stopped, the changes to the AAS environment are lost.

The In Memory Persistence has no additional configuration parameters.
