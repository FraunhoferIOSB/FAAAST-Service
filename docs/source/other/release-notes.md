# Release Notes
<!--start:changelog-header-->
## 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT (current development version)<!--end:changelog-header-->

**New Features & Major Changes**
- Persistence
	- Added Mongo persistence for storing AAS model in MongoDB
- Endpoint
	- Supported AAS Profiles can now be configured per Endpoint
	- HTTP
		- Improved CORS support by introducing additional config properties `corsAllowCredentials`, `corsAllowedHeaders`, `corsAllowedMethods`, `corsAllowedOrigin`, `corsExposedHeaders`, and `corsMaxAge`
		- Improved error messages; stack trace may now be returned in HTTP responses via config property `includeErrorDetails`
		- New API calls: PUT on /upload will now accept JSON/AASX model files. DELETE on /reset will erase everything including AAS, Submodels and ConceptDescriptions.
	- OPC UA
		- Added support for all datatypes of the AAS specification

**Internal changes & bugfixes**
- General
	- Fixed bug when executing an operation asynchronously. When the timeout has expired, the status of the operation was set to timeout, even if the operation  already finished successfully. This does no longer happen - the timeout no longer overwrites the result of the operation.
	- Fix warning message about missing Log4j2 logging implementation
	- Fix registry synchronization because of invalid _interface serialization
	- Fixed bug that occured when having multiple elements in a SubmodelElementList with exactly the same attributes
	- Invoke asynchronous operation now ignores the clientTimeout
	- Model validation no longer throws an error if a model contains multiple instances of exactly the same Identifiable. This is not 100% correct behavior according to the specification as it validates the uniqueness criteria of their ID, however, it helps tremendously when working with existing SMTs as many of them are currently also not 100% standard-compliant and contain such duplicate elements.
- Endpoint
	- HTTP
		- Fixed query modifier `extent` which has not been working as intended
		- Fixed bug in JSON valueOnly deserialization that could occur with complex strcutures (e.g. SubmodelElementCollections within SubmodelElementLists)
		- Fixed bug caused by null values in JSON payload when inserting data via HTTP - null values are now treated as empty/default values
		- Fixed bug "serialization failed" when retrieving a property of type `GDay`
		- Fixed bug where `/aas/asset-information/thumbnail` incorrectly returns `500 Internal Server Error` when property `content-type` is not set
		- Added support for query parameters `assetId` and `idShort` for `/shells/$reference`
		- `/serialization` no longer fails when model contains 'embedded' files but target file format does not. Instead, files are ignored.
		- Enable paging for `/submodel/submodel-elements/$path`
		- Upgraded to Jetty 12
- Serialization
	- JSON
		- Fixed exception occuring when trying to serialize an element as valueOnly that contains elements that do not support valueOnly serialization		
		- Fixed serialization of `Message` object to only include `code` property if set
		- Added support for valueOnly serialization of `BasicEventElement`
- Asset Connection
	- General
		- Fixed bug that caused FA³ST Service to crash when an Asset Connection threw an exception on startup
	- HTTP
		- Remove method and payload from Subscription Provider

## 1.1.0

**New Features & Major Changes**
- General
	- Loading AAS models from JSON now fails on unknown JSON properties
	- Added lambda operation provider
	- Added additional helper methods for resolving idShort and semanticId paths
	- Added support for synchronization with multiple AAS and/or submodel registries
- Asset Connection
	- MQTT
		- Now supports multiple subscription providers to the same topic
- Endpoint
	- HTTP
		- Added new config property `sslEnabled` that allows to disable SSL/HTTPS and use HTTP instead. This is intended for development/testing purposes and some scenarios where FA³ST Service is running behind a proxy server that handles SSL/HTTPS.
		- Added new config property `hostname` to provide hostname of endpoint for automatic registration with registries

**Internal changes & bugfixes**
- General
	- Added log message when starting to indicate that constraint validation is currently not supported
	- Fixed error where complementary files within AASX model files where not correctly loaded when specifying the model file via environment variables
	- Fixed error that prevented loading models in XML format
- Endpoint
	- OPC UA
		- Fixed error when loading models with non-unique idShorts
- Asset Connection
	- MQTT
		- Fixed error that occured when using asset connection in read/subscribe mode with JSON payload that has string properties containing escaped JSON as text
## 1.0.1

- General
	- fixed some date-related unit tests that failed during daylight saving time at thereby prevented compilation of project

## 1.0.0

:::{important}
Version 1.0 is a major update and has breaking changes to all previous versions.
When upgrading to v1.0 please make sure the AAS models and payload you use are compliant to AAS spec v3.0.
Additionally, existing asset connection configurations must be updated in the config file as the serialization format for references has changed in the specificition, e.g., `(Submodel)[IRI]http://example.org/foo,(Property)[ID_SHORT]bar` in older configurations new becomes `(Submodel)http://example.org/foo, (Property)bar`, i.e. the id type has been removed and segments are not separated only by `,` but by `, ` (comma followed by additional space).

**New Features & Major Changes**
- General
	- Updated to AAS metamodel & API v3.0, i.e. older model file (compliant with v2.x, v3.xRCxx) can no longer be loaded with FA³ST Service as-is but have be converted to v3.0
	- Now requires Java 17+
	- Replaced AAS model & de-/serialization library, now using [AAS4J](https://github.com/eclipse-aas4j/aas4j) (previously [Java Model](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/java-model/) and [Java Serializer](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/java-serializer)
	- Default filename for model files changed to `model.*` (previously `aasenvironment.*`)
	- Unified way to configure certificate information ([See details](#providing-certificates-in-configuration)). Affected components: HTTP Asset Connection, OPC UA Asset Connection, HTTP Endpoint, MQTT MessageBus
	- Environment variables now use `_` instead of `.` as a separator
	- Validation - **currently completely disabled as AAS4J does not yet offer validation support**
		- More fine-grained configuration of validation via configuration file
		- Enabled validation for API calls creating or updating elements (basic validation enabled by default)
		- Renamed CLI argument `--no-modelValidation` to `--no-validation`. It now enables any validation when used (overriding validation configuration in configuration file is present)
	- Renamed CLI argument `--emptyModel` to `--empty-model`
- Endpoint
	- HTTP
		- Updated to [AAS API specification v3.0.1](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Plattform_i40/Entire-API-Collection/V3.0.1)

		- Added support for AASX serialization
		- Added support for uploading, deleting and modifying of asset thumbnails and file attachments through API
	- OPC UA Endpoint
		- Updated OPC UA Information model to AAS specification version 3.0. As there is no official mapping of AAS v3.0 to OPC UA, the current mapping is proprietary
		- Added support for configuring supported security policies (`NONE`, `BASIC128RSA15`, `BASIC256`, `BASIC256SHA256`, `AES128_SHA256_RSAOAEP`, `AES256_SHA256_RSAPSS`) and authentication methods (`Anonymous`, `UserName`, `Certificate`)
- MessageBus
	- MQTT-based MessagBus now available that supports running both as embedded MQTT server or using external one
- Asset Connection
	- HTTP
		- Now provides a way to explicitely trust server certificates, e.g. useful when servers are using a self-signed certificate

- Asset Connection
	- OPC UA
		- Unit tests no longer create temp files in source folders
- Starter

- Docker container now runs using a non-root user
- Base persistence configuration updated
	- changed `initialModel` from filename to `AASEnvironment` object

		- /shells/{aasIdentifier}/aas/submodels/{submodelIdentifier}/submodel/submodel-elements/{idShortPath}
	- Using not allowed HTTP methods not correctly returns `405 Method Not Allowed` instead of `500 Internal Server Error`
	- Unsupported URLS (valid URLs with additional path elements) now correctly return `400 Bad Request` instead of `405 Method not allowed`

- Improved console output (less verbose, always displays version info)
- Improved documentation

**Internal changes & smaller bugfixes**
- Validation now checks for unsupported datatypes
- Version info correctly displayed when started as docker container or via local build/debug
- Fixed potential crash when initializing value with empty string althtough that is not a valid value according to the value type, e.g. int, double, etc. (empty string value is treated the same as null)
- Asset Connection
	- Fixed error when using operation provider
	- OPC UA
		- subscription provider now syncs value upon initial connect instead of waiting for first value change on server
	- MQTT
		- print warning upon connection loss
