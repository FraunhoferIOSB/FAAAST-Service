*   Asset Connection
	*   HTTP asset connection added

	*   API
		*   `Submodel Interface` calls now also available in combination with `Asset Administration Shell Interface`, e.g. /shells/{aasIdentifier}/aas/submodels/{submodelIdentifier}/submodel
		*   `Asset Administration Shell Serialization Interface` now supported (at /serialization)
	*   Support for output modifier `content=path`
	*   CORS support, can be enabled by setting `isCorsEnabled=true` in config (default: false)

*   Support for `valueType=DateTime`

*   Support for Java 16

*   Improved robustness (e.g. against common invalid user input or network issues)

*   Improved console output (less verbose, always displays version info)

*   Improved documentation

**Internal changes & smaller bugfixes**
*   Validation now checks for unsupported datatypes

*   Version info correctly displayed when started as docker container or via local build/debug

*   Fixed potential crash when initializing value with empty string althtough that is not a valid value according to the value type, e.g. int, double, etc. (empty string value is treated the same as null)

*   Asset Connection
	*   Fixed error when using operation provider
	*   OPC UA
		*   subscription provider now syncs value upon initial connect instead of waiting for first value change on server
	*   MQTT
		*   print warning upon connection loss
		*   properly handle invalid messages without crashing

*   Added strict enforcement of valid output modifiers for each API call

*   Dynamically allocate ports in unit tests
